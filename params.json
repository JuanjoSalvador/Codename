Currently is in Alpha phase, it needs more developing and developers interested in this project.\r\n\r\nIt uses a Java Swing Interface, but if you don't like Swingyou can download it with GTK interface, as you like!\r\n\r\n### A music player\r\n\r\nCodename supports MP3, FLAC and OGG audio files. Can play all of this types, and soon, much more! Also it can plays files in your computer and online music files (like audio streamings).\r\n\r\n### A music organizer\r\n\r\nCodename can read MP3 metadata and organize your music in folders, like the path `Artist/Album/Track`. Currently only MP3 is supported on the organizer, but soon, other types are available.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nThe project Codename is maintained by [Juan Jos√© Salvador Piedra](http://juanjosalvador.github.io/).
